# VAANI-RAVEN X Source Code Backup

This folder contains all source code files for reference after PyInstaller bundling.
The .exe file may contain compiled/obfuscated code, so these files provide 
readable source code for modifications and debugging.

## Directory Structure

- `agents/` - All 6 agent layer implementations
- `orchestrator/` - Central pipeline coordinator
- `data_pipeline/` - MT5 integration and data collection
- `monitoring/` - Dashboard and monitoring components
- `config/` - System configuration files
- `testing/` - Backtesting and validation engines
- `build/` - PyInstaller specifications
- `training/` - ML model training modules
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

## Usage

After creating the .exe file, use these source files to:
1. Make modifications to the trading system
2. Debug issues or add new features
3. Understand the system architecture
4. Retrain ML models or adjust parameters

All files maintain the same structure as the original codebase.
